# DDPSM
data and python code of the simulation model

Storm Surge & Wind Speed Models:
(the distance from the grid has been precomputed in another script)
a. change the file location.
b. run the model.

Precipitation Model:
a. change the file location (both "read" and "save" filenames).
b. run the QPF model first, then run the PoP model because the PoP model reads data generated by the QPF model.
